# Functions in CPP üßë‚Äçüíª:

## File Details üìÇ:
<li> functions_0.1 <b>"Call by value"</b></li>
<li> functions_0.2 <b>"Call by Address"</b></li>
<li> functions_0.3 <b>"Call by Reference"</b></li>
<li> functions_0.4 <b>"Inline Functions"</b></li>
<li> functions_0.5 <b>"Function Overloading"</b></li>

formal argumenets can be three types:
  1. Call by Value _0.1: <br>
      when formal arguments are ordinary variable. <br>
  2. Call by Address _0.2 <br>
      when formal arguments are pointer variable. <br>
  3. Call by Reference _0.3 <br>
        when formal arguments are reference variable. 
<h2> Inline Function: </h2>
To eliminates, the cost of small function, CPP suggests us to use Inline function. When a function declared as an inline function, it will expand whenever it'll be invoked. At the time of the function call compiler replaces the function call with its code.<br>
The Keyword for inline functions is "inline". Inline is a request hence function can be inline or not. It truly depends on the compiler.<br>
If a function includes these keywords or operations "for, switch, goto, recursion, static variables" then this function can not be created inline by the compiler. <br> 
<br/>
<h2> Function Overloading: </h2>
In CPP, Polymorphism is very useful concept. Function Overloading is run time polymorphism. It means more than one function sharing same names while performing distinct operations. </br>
As exapmle, Area operations is same as in Circle, Rectangle, Square and Parabola with different formulas. Hence they all are using same name for performing different operations. 
</br>
For function overloading there are some rules: </br>
    <ul><li>Exact match (Arguments difference) </li><li>Type Promotion</li><li>Type Conversion</li></ul></br>
<li>Check for file functions_0.5</li>
