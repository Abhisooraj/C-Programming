# Functions in CPP:
formal argumenets can be three types:
  1. Call by Value _0.1: <br>
      when formal arguments are ordinary variable. <br>
  2. Call by Address _0.2 <br>
      when formal arguments are pointer variable. <br>
  3. Call by Reference _0.3 <br>
        when formal arguments are reference variable. 
<h2> Inline Function: </h2>
To eliminates, the cost of small function, CPP suggests us to use Inline function. When a function declared as an inline function, it will expand whenever it'll be invoked. At the time of the function call compiler replaces the function call with its code.<br>
The Keyword for inline functions is "inline". Inline is a request hence function can be inline or not. It truly depends on the compiler.<br>
If a function includes these keywords or operations "for, switch, goto, recursion, static variables" then this function can not be created inline by the compiler. <br>
