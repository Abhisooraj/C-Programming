# CPP-Programming
C++ or CPP (pp stands for "plus plus") Tutorial code for self learning Programs and Blogs for refreshing skills.
<br/>
CPP is object-oriented programming language developed by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup </b> in 1981 at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A. 
<br/>CPP is middle level language which means it fills the gap between Low Level (Machine level language) and High level language. In CPP, A user can do <b>System Programming </b> a.k.a.<b> low level language </b>(ex:- writing operating system) as well as <b> Application Programming </b> a.k.a.<b> High level language</b>(ex:- menu driven customer billing system). 
<br/><b>Bjarne Stroustrup </b> found some flaws in C language as <b>Simulations</b> hence he decide to extend the language by adding various other features from other languages <b> Simula 67</b> Simula67 was the earliest object oriented programming language.C++ was firstly named as <b>"C with classes"</b> C++ is far similiar as C prograamming language.
